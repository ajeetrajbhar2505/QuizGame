Hiring Manager
Microsoft

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at Microsoft. Joining Microsoft has been my dream, and I am eager to contribute to its mission of organizing the world’s information and making it universally accessible and useful.

In my previous roles, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to solve complex problems and deliver impactful results. For example:

Revamped the Corporate Portal and ESOA projects at SBI Mutual Fund, improving system performance by 30% through optimized code, streamlined workflows, and the integration of modern technologies.

I thrive on learning new technologies and adapting to requirements. Whether it’s developing Ionic apps with Angular, integrating Google Auth, implementing real-time communication with Socket.IO, or automating workflows, I am confident in my ability to deliver high-quality solutions. My problem-solving mindset and ability to build logical, efficient code have consistently helped me overcome challenges and create impactful results.

What excites me most about Microsoft is its culture of innovation and its commitment to solving problems that impact billions of users and I am eager to bring my skills in API integration, real-time systems, and automation to contribute to its success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Microsoft’s mission and be part of a team that shapes the future of technology.

Sincerely,
Ajeet Rajbhar
